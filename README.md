* A single level is played three times.
* Each time, the player gains a new ability but loses the previous one.
* The layout stays exactly the same, but how the player solves it changes dramatically.
---
## Environment Design
* A 2D side scroller.
* Common Obstacles :
   - Spikes
   - Moving Platforms
   - Tall Wall
   - Lasers
