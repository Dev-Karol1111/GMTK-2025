##   Game Concept 
* A single level is played a number of  times.
* Each time, the Acolyte gains a new ability but loses the previous one.
* The layout stays exactly the same, but how the Acolyte solves it changes dramatically.
---
## Environment Design
* A 2D side scroller.
* Common Obstacles :
   - Spikes
   - Lasers
   - Tall walls
   - Enemies
